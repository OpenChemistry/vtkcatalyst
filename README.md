# Catalyst

**Catalyst** is an **API specification** developed for simulations (and other scientific data producers)
to analyze and visualize data in situ.

## History

Originally, Catalyst was part of [ParaView][paraview]. However, with ParaView
version 5.9, the Catalyst API was revamped quite extensively and release as an
[independent project][catalyst]. This repository includes the definition
together with a lightweight implementaton of this revamped Catalyst API.

The documentation describing the details, including build instructions and how to use Catalyst
for in situ analysis and visualization in simulations is available
[on readthedocs][catalyst-docs].
